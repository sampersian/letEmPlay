## Let Em' Play

The idea behind this is that I want to connect people who cannot afford hockey equipment with people who would like to donate hockey equipment.

Donors will be able to upload information about their gear:

* What size
* Condition
* Age
* Sex (if applicable)
* Photo of the equipment

Seekers will be able to create a profile for each player that they are seeking gear for.

Player information needed would most likely include:
* Age
* Height
* Weight
* Sex

Something that should be offered is a 'about me' section where the seekers can describe the player and their situation and maybe offer an explanation (probably not the right word to use) for why they would like to play hockey and why they need help with finding equipment.

After entering in this information, seekers will be able to select (hopefully on a super easy diagram that has every piece of equipment 'blown up' so that they can just click on each piece) the equipment they need.

Behind the scenes will be a map showing all locations of available equipment, upon clicking they will see what equipment is available there. There will also be a very similar map showing where the seekers are and what equipment that they will need.

Seekers will get alerts when equipment they are looking for becomes available near them.
